    <h1>New Innovations</h1>
    <h3>Here are some cool developements we've come up with which we think will be very useful in the new-normal.
</h3>
    <h2>1. Hologram making apps</h2>
    <p>Using this application, anyone and everyone will be able to get 3D projections of their pc or mobile
        and thus instead of people going out for restaurant parties, they can set up their house, 
        video call the person and pretend that the person is indeed near you and is having a party with you.

    <br><br>
    <h2>2. Home Theatre</h2>
    <p>We can set home theatres in the empty rooms of our houses and enjoy theatre at home. One of the theatre 
        seating companies is Valencia and they provide a variety of theatre seating options.

    <br><br>
    <h2>3. Home Robot</h2>
    <p>A robot who does all your housework is pretty helpful. Infact, it's very helpful! No need to do the dishes
        anymore after a tiring day at work. Many restaurants have closed and the ones that are remaining are said to
        be good, but it definitely is unhealthy to eat from outside during these tough times. This problem has
        a solution, the Home Robot! Add any recipe you want and get it made by your personal robo-chef!

    <h2>4. Gamer-bot</h2>
    <p>Want anyone to play a round of fortnight with? Or to play a friendly match of chess with? No worries now!
        the Gamer-bot is up for rescue! Play many exciting games and enjoy so much that you'll forget about
        all the pains and sadnesses you ever had.

    <br><br>
    <h2>5. Covo-bot</h2>
    <p>This robot will do all the sanitisation processes required to keep away the virus. It'll be really
        helpful if all the sanitisation was done properly and quickly without a lot of hectic.

    <h2>6. Robo-tester</h2>
    <p>Another robot who tests you and makes sure that you are safe from any virus or disease and if not, you will
        be alerted beforehand so that you can take early treatments and get cured quicker.
